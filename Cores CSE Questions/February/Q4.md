Question 4: Explain condition for Deadlock?

Answer:

In Computer Science a set of process is said to be in deadlock if each process in the set is waiting for an
event that only another process in the set can cause. Since all the processes are waiting, none of them
will ever cause any of the events that would wake up any of the other members of the set & all the
processes continue to wait forever.

Following are the condirion for deadlock: 

**1. Mutual exclusion**

Only one process at a time can use a resource.

**2. Hold and wait**

Process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other
processes.

**3. No preemption**

Resources are released only voluntarily by the process holding the resource, after the process is
finished with it

**4. Circular wait**

There exists a set {P1 , …, Pn } of waiting processes.
P1 is waiting for a resource that is held by P2
P2 is waiting for a resource that is held by P3
…
Pn is waiting for a resource that is held by P1
All of these four conditions must be p
