Question 2: What is NAT ? Explain in brief

Answer:

NAT stands for Network Address Translation. It's a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring the information.To access the Internet, one public IP address is needed, but we can use a private IP address in our private network. The idea of NAT is to allow multiple devices to access the Internet through a single public address. To achieve this, the translation of private IP address to a public IP address is required. Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP addresses are translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts. Also, it does the translation of port numbers i.e. masks the port number of the host with another port number, in the packet that will be routed to the destination. It then makes the corresponding entries of IP address and port number in the NAT table. NAT generally operates on router or firewall.

Generally, the border router is configured for NAT i.e the router which has one interface in local (inside) network and one interface in the global (outside) network. When a packet traverse outside the local (inside) network, then NAT converts that local (private) IP address to a global (public) IP address. When a packet enters the local network, the global (public) IP address is converted to a local (private) IP address.
