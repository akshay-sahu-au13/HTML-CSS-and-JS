Question 6: For the given cache of size 3 and below inputs tell the cache HIT rate .
5 4 3 2 1 3 5 6 7 8 10 15
Explain each step briefly.

Answer:

we will update hit or miss after incoming element.
for the first 3 elements we have 3 miss
cache = [5,4,3]
hit = 0
miss = 3
when the next element comes in cache, and it is a miss, it gets added to right and one element gets removed from left
cache = [4,3,2]
hit = 0
miss = 4
next element 1 enters from right and 4 got removed from left.
cache = [3,2,1]
hit = 0 
miss = 5
now 3 enters and it is a match, so 3 will come to the right
cache = [2,1,3]
hit = 1
miss = 5
there is no further hit found in the given data, so the final result is
cache = [8,10,15]
hit = 1
miss = 11
so the hit rate = (total hit/total request) X 100
		       = (1/12) X 100
		       = 8.3 %
Hit rate = 8.3 %
