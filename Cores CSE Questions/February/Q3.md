Question 3: What is Private IP Address ?

The organizations that distribute IP addresses to the world reserves a range of IP addresses for private networks.

Your simple home network, with its router at the center and computers connected to it, be it wired or wireless are classified as one of private networks. Your private address is just for your router, your network, and you and the private address ranges in a network don’t have to be synchronized with the rest of the world and the Internet.

These blocks of addresses can be used by a private network. Even if your neighbor is using the exact same addresses, it won’t cause a problem, because that’s their network, not yours.
