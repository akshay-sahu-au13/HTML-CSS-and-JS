Question 1: What is ARP ? Explain in brief

Answer:

ARP stand for "Address Resolution Protocol." ARP is a protocol used for mapping an IP address to a computer connected to a local network LAN. The gateway uses the ARP to locate the MAC address of the computer based on the IP address the data is being sent to. The ARP converts the IP address to the MAC address of the machine. This ensures each computer has a unique network identification.

ARP is used when information sent to a network arrives at the gateway, which serves as the entrance point to the network. The gateway uses the ARP to locate the MAC address of the computer based on the IP address the data is being sent to. The ARP typically looks up this information in a table called the "ARP cache." If the address is found, the information is relayed to the gateway, which will send the incoming data to the appropriate machine. It may also convert the data to the correct network format if necessary.
